<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big engine that couldn’t. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s like Clue, mixed with Sherlock Holmes, trapped on a
train! Wait, let me rephrase. It’s like being trapped on a train, watching a
bunch of people who don’t understand the rules, play a super long game of
Clue.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This film was a literal snoozefest (that’ll come into play
later in the review). It wasn’t a complete train wreck, the director/star
Branagh had a pretty sweet moustache. Aside from that though, yeah, it was all
bad. There was nothing exciting or intriguing offered up here, and any momentum
the story initially had going for it got buried in the avalanche along with the
train. After that, the bloated running time was spent switching between
unearned exposition and force feeding us red herrings like we were protein
deficient pescatarians. I’d like to qualify and expand that last statement, but
for the sake of not spoiling the mystery reveal, I’ll leave it there.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of updating this version, Branagh opted to double
down on the outdatedness and have his all-star cast play caricature archetypes.
(If Hollywood ever sends a live action version of the board game <i>guess who?</i>
down the pipeline, this is the man for the job.) Still this eccentric take
could have worked if only the brilliant detective would have been written with
some brilliance, or if the clues had been even slightly clever and inventive.
What we signed up for was to watch a master of deduction piece together subtle
but brilliant clues that only seem obvious after he brings them to the
forefront for us. What we got was two hours of a truffle pig snorting and
splashing around in shit, before, finally, slobbering a mouth full of fungus on
our newly polished shoes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was a whodunit so tedious, coming home after and trying
to figure out which of my step kids forgot to flush felt like an exhilarating game
of wits, by contrast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t remember the original, and I only saw this one in
its entirety because as I started to nod off – which is something I’ve never
done in a movie before - a tub of popcorn tipped out of the hands of the
sleeping moviegoer to my right and spilled over into my seat (a true story!).
It was a dark theater, but judging by the rollcall of scattered snoring, at
least a half dozen in my theater alone paid to take a nap, and that’s only
counting the people with blocked nasal passages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better movie inspired in part by the original and
carrying a lot of the same themes and set up: Watch the 1976 comedy<i> Silver
Streak</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better version: Watch the original Murder on the
Orient Express(1974). I can’t say for sure it’s better, but it can’t be worse.
Besides, if it sucks, at least you’ll fall asleep in the comfort of your own
house, away from rogue tubs of popcorn  </p>
