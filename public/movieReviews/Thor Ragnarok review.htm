<p class=MsoNormal>If you want lightning in a bottle, look no further than the
god of thunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thor score and seven films ago (if you include that two-part
short) Chris Hemsworth first donned the blonde wig. None of the previous films
were horrible, but his standalones were among Marvel’s weakest and, while the Avengers
had a lot to offer, watching a royal demigod struggle to match body counts
against his human teammates - who specialize in things like karate and archery
– wore thin, in a hurry.  When I first heard they were setting this one on
different planets and bringing the Hulk along for the ride, I knew they were on
the right track, but I never hoped for something this good. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like an expert comedian, burning their closing bit by using
it as an opener and therefor forcing themselves to come up with stronger
material: Ragnarok robbed Thor of his hair, hammer and kingdom before the
second act was underway. In doing this, not only were we treated to an
exhilarating opening, drenched with a condensed version of what we’ve only got
a taste of from this character up until now; but we then got to see a Thor who
was outmatched and in uncharted territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story was fantastic and, though, a lot of the scenes
were largely improvised, it played as one of the most well thought out movies
of its kind. Director Taika Waititi – Who plays the comic relief “Korg” – was
exactly what this genre has been missing. Injecting the film with his
particular brand of kookiness and leaning into the humor of things, he managed
to not only reinvigorate my excitement for Thor and Hulk, but for comic book
movies in general. It would be a crime if this showing doesn’t earn the man his
pick of projects from now on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This movie was so complete at every level that the
tremendous performances and new characters, which would be the high point of
any other film in this class, have to be relegated here to basically an aside.
Suffice it to say, if any of a handful of these characters get their own
spinoff movie, it’ll be warranted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll love this one.  If
you’re not, honestly, I’d still recommend it. This movie was pure fun. Plain
and simple. </p>
