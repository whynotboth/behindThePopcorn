<p class=MsoNormal>Lady Bird (2012) Review</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A year in the life of a young woman living in northern California
who believes she’s bigger than the town she’s from.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Written/Directed by: Greta Gerwig (<i>Frances Ha</i>, <i>Mistress
America).</i></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Orange County</i> meets <i>Garden State</i>, without the
pizazz. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based loosely on Gerwig’s own life and where she’s from.
Lady Bird was an honest and truthfully told coming of age story, that I’m sure
will ring like a cult anthem to many a millennial. It was relatable and real
and never the less, boring. Like taking a trip through a high schoolers diary:
It was fun and intriguing at first, but after 100 pages it started to feel more
like being stuck on a long bus ride in which you asked the wrong person ‘how’s
it going?’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>coming in, I assumed that if I didn’t care for this movie,
it would surely be because it just wasn’t ‘for’ me. That it would be a good
film but I wouldn’t be able to understand or connect. As it turns out, the
problem for me was quite the opposite.  This film does a fantastic job of
capturing characters at a certain time in their lives – as a child, parent,
sibling, and young adult – that we’ve all gone through. But, maybe that’s just
not enough anymore? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem with the modern day coming of age tale is, we’re
a generation who records and captions every emotion, micro-milestone, and urge
in real time. The world is a battlefield, and we’re all armed to the teeth with
unlimited automatic time capsules. And because of that, every day when you log
onto your social media and scroll past the latest TimeHop, it feels like you’re
ingesting real, relatable coming of age stories by the handful. Watching a film
all about the petty little struggles we all face used to feel like a
validation. Unfortunately, that ‘WHAT?! ME TOO!’ feeling I used to get from
them has been replaced with a dismal ‘…yeah, we know.’ There’s nothing left
unexplored about the purely relatable anymore, not on its own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The acting was marvelous (We’re probably looking at a string
of Oscar nominations here) and first time solo director Greta Gerwig was about
as comfy in her chair as Captain James T. Kirk was in his. If this movie came
out a decade ago, or attached itself to a more objective plot, this would have
been a way different review. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As it stands, this movie may have captured some raw truth,
but it failed to capture my attention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better coming of age movie: Watch <i>boyhood</i>
(which could have just as easily been called sisterhood or motherhood or
fatherhood)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For female driven movies I enjoyed more, tackling these
themes and subjects: <i>Pieces of April</i> or <i>Ghost World. </i></p>
