<p class=MsoNormal>The Snowman Review 2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not even a magical hat could bring this snowman to life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I suppose, for the sake of orientation, I will note that
this movie was a thriller, based on a book, in which Michael Fassbender plays a
cop who is either targeting and/or targeted by a serial killer. Aside from
that, there’s really nothing worth emphasizing, and it’s in that spirit that I
have decided to switch things up a bit. Seeing as how my usual format - in
which I begin each review by briefing you on the movie at hand with a list of
key facts and helpful details – is rendered null by this debacle of a film, I’m
instead going to end this review with a spoiler filled (can you spoil something
that was rotten from the onset?) bullet-point list of queries I had rattling
around in my head as I left the theater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would analyze this movie in more detail, but I fear I’ve
already well surpassed the amount of time and effort spent by any other writer
regarding this project.</p>

you might have when leaving a David Lynch movie. Don’t read these and mistake
the lack of craftmanship for artistry) </p>

choice a shotgun or the wire saw thing? None of that was congruent with his
pathology. Shouldn’t he have drowned his victims instead? </p>
