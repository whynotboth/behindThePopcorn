<p class=MsoNormal>Last Flag Flying (2017) Review</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Thirty years after serving together in Vietnam, a former Navy
Corpsman reunites with his old pals in the wake of his son, a young Marine’s
death. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Written and Directed by: Richard Linklater (<i>Dazed and
Confused, Before Sunrise, Boyhood</i>)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Starring: Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was cast all wrong. Maybe if Carell and Fishburne
switched parts? Who knows. Cranston, in the token Ethan Hawk role, was the
bright spot. Though, I couldn’t help but wonder what could have been had
Linklater just Cast Hawk in that part, like nature intended. (I’m not saying
Tim Burton needs to put Johnny Depp in every film from now on, simply because
he has in the past. I’m not even saying both of their careers wouldn’t be arguably
better off if they discontinued their relationship all together. I’m simply
saying, if you watch a Burton film and there’s a character in full white face
who’s not Depp, the whole thing seems slightly amiss, that’s all.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The scope of this one wasn’t quite right: If the film would
have started earlier with just Carell’s character, back at home, and made us
feel like despite the estrangement, his military pals were the only ones who
could understand his plight. Or if the group would have been closer or simultaneously
struggling with their own larger than life ‘civilian’ problems - too big to
handle alone, but as a unit: manageable. Or if the dead son would have been a
fourth platoon pal that they all owed a debt to, and thus were equally beholden
to and invested in instead of being basically an awkward favor for 2/3 of the
group.  Maybe then, the movie would have been gripping. But as is, it was
simply a character piece in which the only thing keeping them tethered together
was boredom, guilt trips, and a need to make feature length running time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story was told with a light touch, especially
considering the subject matter, and there were genuine moments across the
spectrum that were truly affecting. Overall, however, the story meandered and
just didn’t quite come together. I can’t place the blame in an exact spot with
guaranteed accuracy, considering Linklater has made a career out of plays such
as: putting the camera on a couple as they walk around Paris and talk about
whatever; putting the camera on a bunch of people in Austin as they talk about
whatever; putting the camera on a family for 12 years as they talk about
whatever – and not only has it worked, but it’s been god damn brilliant every
time! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think, contrary to everything I’ve said this year about
character pieces and coming of age stories, the problem here is he injected too
<u>much</u> plot into this. (Linklater gets a pass on going plotless. I don’t
know how or why, but the man knows how to be a fly on the wall with assassin
level precision.) He’s made some great movies that were pure plot, and he’s
made others that defied narrative convention all together, but it’s in going
for both in the same film that things got jumbled and laborious. You can’t eat
your cake and have it too, as they say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The film was respectful of our troops while not pandering to
them, and it didn’t shy away from aspects of serving and the aftermath that
most filmmakers are too afraid to touch, I really appreciated that. Over all,
there was some beauty to be had here, but it was easily my least favorite of
Linklater’s canon. Ultimately <i>Last Flag Flying</i> never flew above half-masts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better movie about soldiers and the voids left by war,
even if that’s the only similarity to this film: Watch <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For better movies by Richard Linklater: Watch <i>The Before
Trilogy</i>, <i>Bernie</i>, <i>School of Rock</i>. </p>
