<p class=MsoNormal>My trajectory with LBJ the movie was poetically similar to
the one this country shared with LBJ the man. As worthy as the movie may have
been, it was simply outmatched. I had been wooed by a younger, idealistic, much
more handsome one (Thor). I stood outside the crowded ticket booth, feeling
excited and optimistic for the Marvel-ous evening that lied ahead, when
suddenly - tragedy struck. As I went to swipe my card, after having selected my
seat, someone at another window plucked it away from me, in the blink of an
eye. The last good seat for Ragnarok, gone. Whether or not this heartless prick
at the cementy kiosk acted alone, we may never know. It was a moment of great
tragedy, and in that moment, like it or not, there was only one film qualified
to take its spot. So, begrudgingly, I took my chair between two grey ponytail
sporting gentlemen and braced myself for this new chapter in my night. And I’ve
gotta say, I thought it was surprisingly good! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Woody Harrelson was fantastic in the titular role and really
gave the character life. Especially when playing against the brilliant Richard
Jenkins as Senator Russell. Harrelson’s trademark southern charm was a natural
fit for the part, and was made all the more credible by the wholesome (even
when making dick metaphors) directing style of Reiner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this movie got right was its willingness to explore the
little moments that happened in between the headlines and present a portrait
without turning the characters into architypes. I also really appreciated the
timeline of this movie. By centering the story around the VP years I was able
to see a side of this man - and history - that’s usually muddied with the
Vietnam of it all.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mind you, it’s a movie about LBJ, so don’t go in expecting
it to not be that. But I can honestly say, aside from the prosthetics, which at
times looked like they would be more at home in <i>Sin City</i>, this was a
pretty complete picture. I Laughed out loud several times and walked away with
an interest and appreciation for President Johnson that wasn’t there going in.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For other presidential biopics: Watch <i>Lincoln</i>(2012)
or for an optimal double feature, pair this with <i>JFK</i>(1991)</p>
