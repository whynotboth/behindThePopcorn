<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the time of writing this, Wind River is my front runner
for best movie of the year. The acting was outstanding on all accounts, in
fact, Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen work so well together on screen it
makes me long for a Hawk Eye/ Scarlett Witch spinoff. The writer/director
Taylor Sheridan doesn’t tell wild extravagant stories and he doesn’t embellish
in the name of being cinematic. He finds ways of life, and the simple truths
hidden in the cracks within and lets them speak for themselves. And holy hell,
do they speak! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carving out his story using a tool I haven’t seen much of in
the last decade: patience - Sheridan is able to immerse us in this unambiguous,
barebones “luck don’t live here” as Jeremy Renner’s character puts it, world. The
writer’s true talent is in capturing culture and circumstance and letting them
unfold on their own until the bitter end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like the last couple Sheridan has penned, this has the feel
of a modern day western. Only unlike most westerns, modern or not, the antagonist
is more than just an evil man who can be eliminated, restoring peace and
happiness to everything around, it’s also a series of systemic shortcomings
that live within us and all around us. In setting this story on a snowy
desolate Indian reservation he strips away the modern comforts that distract
and occupy, giving us a portrait of how dark it can get when you have nothing
to entertain your mind but painful memories and regrets. This film captures
generations of suffering and mistakes and leaves you feeling affected long after
the ending credits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now’s as good of a time as any, I suppose, to mention that
the movie is also really funny at times. For as dark and hopeless feeling as
the subject matter is, especially considering it’s inspired by a real-life
epidemic (the film ends with the haunting words “while missing person
statistics are compiled for every other demographic, none exist for Native
American women.”), the film never feels like a Sarah McLachlan commercial. That
is to say, it’s by no means all medicine. you don’t have to be in any
particular mood to appreciate this one, though maybe pick a bubblier one for a
first date. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Double feature: Watch Hell or High Water and Wind River back
to back and enjoy a night of forgetting about yourself.</p>
