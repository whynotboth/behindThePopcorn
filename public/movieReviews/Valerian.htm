<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Valerian and
the City of a Thousand Planets (this week’s obligatory comic book adaptation) helmed
by the once great Luc Besson, packed in some intermittent pizazz, sure to
excite fans of Besson’s earlier work. Unfortunately, however, he was only able
to muster up just enough magic to ward off the filing of a missing person’s
report. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The set
pieces were often times fun and engaging but ultimately couldn’t stand up to
the barrages of clunker dialog and forced formulaic confrontation. For a 3D
movie, the peril never advanced past 2D.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Besson who
has graced us with some of cinemas greatest, albeit most manic, villains of all
time, drastically underwrote his antagonist this go around; or, possibly, just
forgot to call his ace in the hole, Gary Oldman. This proved costly, leaving
the integrity of the entire story out to dry on the shoulders of the two main
characters and their heavy-handed will they or wont they - or, frankly, who
gives a shit - romantic subplot. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>The
writer/director has always had a knack for taking first time actors, former
models, and the otherwise monosyllabic and passing off their lack of acting
chops as some form of badass stoicism. But in this case, it comes off less like
an essentric casting choice and more like a calculated attempt at pandering to
a youthful, cool obsessed demographic. I have a few small bones to pick with
their acting, but my real gripe, and I suspect yours as well, is with the
chemistry - which was so rudimentary, it teetered on alchemy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Valerian
ultimately had a little bit for everyone, but not a hell of a lot for anyone.
If you’ve got the money and the time, there are worse ways to kill two hours.
Though, currently at your local cinema, there are also several better ways. </span></p>
