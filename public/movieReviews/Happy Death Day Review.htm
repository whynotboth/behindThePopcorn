<p class=MsoNormal>Happy Death Day Review (2017)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A college student is stuck reliving the day of her murder until
she can discover her killers identity.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Directed by Christopher Landon: Paranormal Activity: The Marked
Ones. (He also wrote the previous 3 Paranormal Activity films)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The movie wasn’t a total dud, but
that’s almost entirely due to how well the loop-time setup and horror movie genre
complement one another. The concept was intriguing, and one I bet we’ll see
resurface again, but that aside, I spent the back half waiting for this one to
end.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The protagonist was so aggressively
unlikable that a collective sigh of relief was let out into the audience every
time the killer did its thing. Instead of building in a character arc or some
sort of progression that urges you to actively route for the lead to find and
foil her killer – aside from knowing that would bring the sweet mercy of the
ending credits – they simply made the character an asshole beyond redemption and
tossed on a post-hoc sob story of an explanation for why she was the way she
was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>It had the potential to be good,
if only it didn’t take itself so seriously. Instead of embracing how ridiculous
the situation was and having a little fun, it tried to string everything into a
sincere message that I’m not entirely convinced they weren’t just making up on
the fly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If I had to guess, the moral was
something along the lines of: Even a self-centered prick can change it all
around, just so long as everyone in her life has been pushed to a reasonable
suspicion of having cause to kill her; she’s forced to be hunted down and
murdered on a continuous loop, and she finally considers giving up sleeping
with married men and/or her closest friends’ boyfriends for a semester. The
message might have also been: If you find out a guy at the party whom you
didn’t know until today, just simply didn’t date rape you last night – you’ve
found true love. I can’t say for sure, but I’m giving myself the benefit of the
doubt that I didn’t miss something subtle with this one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Not to spoil anything for you,
especially because you’ll be forced to watch these scenes at tedium, but this
is the kind of movie where as soon as she decides to take her fate into her own
hands and find out the identity of the killer, she does everything – mostly just
giving herself makeovers to fit the plan of the day – except make even the
slightest attempt to pull off the killer’s mask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>What I would have liked to have
seen was some sort of detective like clue gathering where each day, win or
lose, she figured out another crucial and game changing piece of the puzzle.
That would have invested us in her journey and made every day matter on its own
to the story. Instead the writer opted to make it a long series of episodic
reruns (At one point, after returning from a long bathroom break to seemingly
the same scene he’d left during, I overheard a fellow moviegoer asking his date
sarcastically “what did I miss?”).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If I find out the writer got his
start in film as an accountant, I’ll completely reverse my opinion of his work.
Film a few two-minute scenes and make them take up the bulk of the movies
running time. Brilliant.  If not, however, this movie forever goes down as a
movie that could have been.</p>

Day, Source Code, The Edge of Tomorrow</i>.</p>
