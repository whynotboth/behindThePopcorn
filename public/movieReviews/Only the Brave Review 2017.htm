<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Going into this movie as a reviewer, I felt like I was
looking into the barrel of my worst nightmare. A film about a bunch of
Hollywood pretty-boys lifting weights and pretending to be brave heroes while
in-between gigs at Marvel. It was not only based on a true story, but a true
story about firefighters: So, no matter how badly it sucked, I knew I couldn’t
trash it without using a dozen parenthetical qualifiers and lying about having
a firefighting uncle to blunt the backlash. It starred Miles Teller – who’s
played enough American masculine working-class characters this year to give The
Village People grounds for a lawsuit, and it’s just under 2 hours and 15
minutes long. Yikes. But, alas, I am a man of the people and plus it was a slow
movie release week, so saw it, I did. And as it turns out, it wasn’t half bad!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The movie could have been shorter, and I wish Andie
MacDowell would have gotten a smidgen more screen time but otherwise, it was a
decent work on all accounts. They slow played the character development over a
long timeline, so you really got to enjoy seeing the relationships form and
change and witness the kind of commitment and fortitude required not only in
doing the job, but in sharing your life with someone who does.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know less than nothing about the real life subject matter,
but from what I could tell, it was an honest earnest depiction, and while it’s
not exactly an upper of a film, I think it’s worth viewing for anyone who can
relate to the story, or anyone willing to take the journey with this crew. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The writing and directing were both impressive, and on both
accounts, there was successful zigging where lesser artists would have zagged.
However, this movie hinged entirely on the collective sincerity of the large
cast, and fortunately, they unanimously delivered; turning what, by all
accounts, should have been shameless Oscar-bait into a pretty emotional
portrait. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For another ride with the same pace and tone: Watch <i>Everest</i>(2015)
also starring Josh Brolin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a less emotionally draining firefighter movie: Watch <i>Backdraft</i>(1991)</p>
