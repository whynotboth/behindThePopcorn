<p class=MsoNormal>The Foreigner is sort of two different movies. On the one
hand you have a story about Jackie Chan going on a one-way mission of
retribution, but on the other, you have a political drama where Pierce Brosnan
tries to navigate the destabilizing harmony between his cultural loyalties and
political responsibilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As intriguing as both are (and as masterfully told as I’m
sure it was in the book), the movie would have benefited from cutting out one
and focusing on the other more fully. I respect the craft involved in showing
every character’s unique plight, but in a father-wants-revenge movie, the ride
goes a lot smoother when you’re not forced to empathize with the bad guy, and
the good guy isn’t afraid to inflict more than a walk-in visits worth of damage
to the people in his way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By telling the story from both sides, we weren’t treated to
the tunnel vision feeling of reckless abandon and all-consuming certainty that
punctuate the genre. Instead, we were served a birds-eye view of the painful
shades of grey that, more realistically, riddle these sorts of conflicts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I appreciated being privy to the whole picture: Ignorance,
as they say, is bliss. I prefer my bloodlust movies to be belligerently short
sited. Me good, you bad. *knocks out henchman’s teeth with something inventive*
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully this isn’t saying more about me than the movie
but, the inciting murder didn’t really phase me. They didn’t let us get to know
the daughter well enough to care that she died, and Chan’s character was far too
reasonable and polite to stir up any real tribal hate. What I found affecting
me the most was the smaller interrelationship betrayals and deceits that took
place behind closed doors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan were both fantastic and while
seeing the pair tomcat around on the big screen was reason enough to justify my
movie ticket, If you don’t hold the actors in the same regard as I, you can
probably hold off on this one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To see Brosnan play a similar role more fully: <i>The</i> <i>Ghost
writer</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To see a better revenge style movie: Watch <i>Taken</i>, or
basically any movie Mel Gibson made in the 90’s.</p>
