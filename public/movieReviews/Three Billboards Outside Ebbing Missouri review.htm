</span></span>Dark Comedy/Drama.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I found myself having the same bratty feeling halfway into
Three Billboards that I get around noon every Sunday. Even though I was having
a decent time, I couldn’t help but wallow in the knowledge that I would soon be
back to reality, and with another eternity between me and the next McDonagh
film, I couldn’t help but resent the moment for not being just a little better.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike the writer/director’s previous works, this was a
smaller, more grounded story. Focusing on Frances McDormand’s character and her
understandably misguided attempt to make herself whole in the wake of an
unthinkable tragedy. The fate of the film rested on McDormand’s performance,
which is handy because, not to jinx it, I think she might have just won herself
another Oscar here; thanks largely to the huge performances by her supporting
cast (aside from Abbie Cornish - who I like, but whose accent was strangely
distracting in this Missouri tale). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was a dark comedy about revenge and regret that managed
to neither glorify not apologize for its violence, and while it was a slow burn
- I wasn’t sure if I even liked it in the beginning - as the movie went on, I
began enjoying it more and more. The dialogue, as always, was juicy and sharp
and the morality was almost snuck through the backdoor without anyone noticing.
This is the kind of film that, I assume, will improve with each viewing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Martin McDonagh’s best film to date: Watch <i>In Bruges</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To hold you over until his next one: Watch <i>The Guard,
Calvary</i> (written/directed by his brother John Michael McDonagh)</p>
