<p class=MsoNormal>Jigsaw (2017) Review</p>

</span></span>As a new sadistic game begins, murders start showing up which
bear all the same markings as the jigsaw killer’s; leaving the cops to wonder
if they’re chasing a copycat or if Jigsaw has somehow returned from the dead. </p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A sequel to the <i>Saw</i> horror/thriller movies </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most disingenuous movies of the year: <i>Jigsaw</i>
gutted out all the competence, moral psychology and sleuth the original <i>Saw</i>
centered around and instead used the packaging to force-feed us what was essentially
an hour and a half long session of middle-school-grade Truth or Dare. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The traps weren’t clever. The victims had all the
coordination and common sense of the folks trying to use every day kitchen
appliances in late night infomercials. The detective in charge of solving this
case was always two steps behind the audience and spent most of the movie
chewing gum and smirking at nothing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without exception, the characters were unlikable, bland and
the motives were either nonexistent or so forced that it felt like
condescension.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last act – which was pretty much just a long, horse
shit, expository monolog – manically tried to sneak a plot into this otherwise
pointless and tedious movie. But no amount of desperate smashing together of
these puzzle pieces could have transformed jigsaw into a complete picture. The
ending felt less like a well deliberated reveal, and more like a petulant kid
trying to sneak in a few more minutes of playtime after mommy already demanded
it was time to close the box and put this one to bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a movie with a built-in fan base. I saw it with a large
crowd on opening night and it’s a thriller. As the lights dimmed before the
movie, I was worried there would be so much audience participation I’d have to
watch this one twice just to write an accurate review; 45 minutes into it,
surrounded by a crushing silence, I almost felt the need to personally start
blurting out spoilers and opinions, just to boost group morale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better “rats in a maze” movie: Watch <i>Cube</i>(1997)
or <i>The Cabin in the Woods</i>(2012)</p>
